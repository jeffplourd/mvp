There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  WordWallet

## Sub-Heading ##
  
  
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Middle school, high school, and university students, and people working in the professional marketplace (e.g. finance, tech, medicine) who have an extraordinary amount of information they need to understand, absorb and remember, and then be able to discuss and apply these ideas at a later date.


## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.


  Imagine you're in a lecture or reading the newspaper and you find a word or concept you don't know. If you want to deeply understand the overall text, you have two options: You can quickly lookup the word in a dictionary or infer its meaning from context.

  If you infer the word's meaning from context, you often miss the complete meaning of the word, and your overall comprehension suffers. On the other hand, If you lookup the word in a dictionary, it often takes an anoyingly long time to find the right definition and, again, overall comprehension suffers. Despite each of these strategies' shortcomings, niether get at the heart of the issue.

  The problem is that when you infer from context or reference a dictionary, you gain an incomplete and temporary understanding of the word. But, you run the risk of not seeing the word again for a few weeks or months and by that time you have already forgotten it and need to look it up again.

  (include research re: rate of deterioration of memory)

  But what if there were an app that could help?

  You whip out your phone or open a new tab in your browser and go to "an app" (WordWallet) to lookup the meaning of the unfamiliar word. Instead of reading an esoteric definition, you watch and listen to a brief, snapchat-like video that introduces the word.

  Later that night or the next morning, you spend 5-10 minutes re-watching brief, entertaining snapchat-like videos that explain the word and how to use it, followed by exercises that allow you to play with and get a better understanding of the word.

  After each successful exercise, the app places the word on hold to come back right at the point when you're starting to forget it - starting at small intervals and gradually increasing (to take advantage of the spacing effect) - so you remember the word when you come accross it again in the real world.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  The problem this product solves is reducing the 'friction' between seeing an unfamiliar word or concept while reading or listing to someone speak and being able to understand the word, and remember it at a later date.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  WordWallet provides quick access to understandable definitions of words through it's web and phone apps, and browser plug-ins, and a fun, effective way to followup and develop a deep understanding of the words through engaging exerises.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  All it takes to get started it to go to our webpage or phone app and type in the word you not familiar with. Then, just like you would watch a snapchat from a friend, you can watch and listen to the unfamiliar word. If you want to add the word to your wordwallet, then you would would create an account and using Google, Facebook and or by entering a username and password and you will be automatically login in and ready to review your words whenever convenient.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "I'm currently a high school student in Las Vegas. Growing up, my parents and family only spoke Spanish at home, so the only time I read or heard academic words was at school. I would often hear my teachers use big words and I wasn't brave enough to rasing my hand and ask what it meant, not to mention that my hand would be constantly raised because there were so many words I didn't know. Six months ago, I started using WordWallet to learn each word and review them each day before school. Now I'm understanding my lectures and I feel compfortable using the words when speaking to my teachers before, during and after class."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  If you care about understanding what people are talking about and comprehending what you read, if you care about being understood by friends and family, and if you care about reaching your educational and professional goals, then you should care about improving your vocabulary.

  The next time you don't get a word, don't skip it or look it up in any old dictionary, add it to your word wallet.
